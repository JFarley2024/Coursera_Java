# Coursera JavaScript Course - Moudule 5 Final Project

The goal of this project was to create a travel website where users could input their destination wishlist, entering the name, location, photo url and a short description.
This information will be displayed on screen and can be appended to, in order to create a wish list that individual items can be removed from.
